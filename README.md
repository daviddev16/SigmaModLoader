# Quick Update
[Check it out](https://github.com/mantrabr/SigmaModLoader/issues/6)

# SigmaModLoader _Experimental (Pre-Alpha)_
Sigma Mod Loader is a _experimental_ unity-game library that can help you on building an embbed mod system easily.


# Overview
I have developed this library for those who want to implement a mod system in their own games easier. This library use 2 methods of comunication:
the `MethodCaller` and `Signals`, with this two components you can establish a connection between the actual game and the mod library, with the `ModManagerSystem`
you can call all these events  creating a persistent library for mod creators use out of game project.

# Note
this library may contains some bugs since I'm using a lot of Reflections methods to load library out of the project. I'm working really hard to make it estable as possible.
Use the *Issues* tab to request new features or report some bug.

I'm try to make this project stable and useful for anyone who want to implement this kind of system. Any suggestion for the project, here is my discord: *Daviiid#4823* 
i will be posting a sample project/code soon.

# Soon
- [ ] All API classes **documented**.
- [ ] `VirtualBehaviour` built-in.
- [ ] The whole project available in library file _(.dll)_
- [ ] Utility classes that can helps the communication with the UnityEngine library.
- [ ] Sample projects for study purpose only.

# Thank you!
thank you for taking your time to read this! I just want to do something useful for game devs.
